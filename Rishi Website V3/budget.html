    <div class="header3"><h2>Budget Type - 80/20</h2></div>
    <div class="content80" >  <p>This is one of the many budgets available, and it is fairly simple. 80 percent of all income goes into expenditures: living expenses, insurance, utilities, and more. In addition, 80 percent could go into desires as well. However, it is recommended that you spend 80 percent on necessities and then allocate the rest to desires. The remaining 20 percent of income goes into savings, which can be used for emergencies or saved for retirement. Additionally, when using this budget, we must account for taxes beforehand and use the after-tax income for budgeting.</p>

    <div class="header4"><h3>Budget Type - 50/30/20</h3></div>

   <div class="content50"> <p>While using this budget, we must account for taxes beforehand and use the after-tax income. The main objective of this budget is to split your expenditures into three main categories: necessities, desires, and savings. In this budget, fifty percent of your income goes towards necessities. The other thirty percent goes towards wants, such as clothing, shoes, and more. Additionally, when spending on goods, you must ensure that you still meet the savings goal of twenty percent. The last 20 percent goes towards savings, helping to set you up for the future. Furthermore, 20 percent of your budget should be dedicated to savings, as this is crucial for your financial future.</p>
